# Spectrograph development project
 
 This repository contains materials related to the construction of and software design for a small, versatile astronomical spectrograph based on the [UVEX](spectro-uvex.tech) (**U**ltra**V**iolet **Ex**plorer) design by [ARAS](http://www.astrosurf.com/aras/).
 
 The development work was initiated by me (Caden Gobat) for my term project for the [PHYS 2152](http://bulletin.gwu.edu/search/?P=PHYS%202152) course at the George Washington University, under the direction of Sylvain Guiriec.
